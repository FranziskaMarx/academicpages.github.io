Hi! I’m Fanqi Yan; thanks for visiting my homepage. 

Now I'm a PhD student in the department of Computer Science, the University of Texas at Austin. It’s very lucky for me to be supervised by Professor Nhat Ho(https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). My research interests are machine learning, optimization, partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, now mainly focus on the mixture of experts.

Previously I’m a visiting researcher at [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/members/) in Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), supervised by Professor [Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/).

I received my master’s degree in Computational Mathematics at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://www.amss.ac.cn/) and bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn/), China. As a graduate student, I was lucky to be a member of the [State Key Laboratory of Scientific and Engineering Computing (LSEC)](http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/) at UCAS working on theories and algorithms for adaptive finite element methods (AFEM), first principles electronic structure calculations and generalized eigenvalue problems. Previously I have studied the nonlinear differential equation problems and traffic signal optimizations at ZJU and worked as a quantitative strategy researcher in [Zhejiang QuantDo Investment Management Co.,Ltd.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zhejiang-quantdo-investment-co--ltd-/about/).
