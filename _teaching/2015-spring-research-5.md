* Abstracted a mathematical model for a real life problem: Designed various phase combinations for different intersections to improve traffic capacity and reduce vehicle delay
* Simplified traffic flow into three phases with Graph Theory
* Proposed the linear programming for the best phase combination optimized for each intersection
