* Advisor: Prof. Xiaoliang Cheng
* Date: Jun 2015 - May 2016
* Designed MATLAB algorithm for the $Ka\breve{c}anov$ method; analyzed the convergence and the effectiveness of the method on selected examples
* Proposed a composite Ka$\breve{c}$anov method with a wider application range, higher accuracy, and faster convergence speed
* Derived the analytical solution to a special type of strain-limiting nonlinear elastic model based on the image patterns of numerical experiments
