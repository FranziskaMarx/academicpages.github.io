* Reviewed the basic theory and algorithm of AFEM for elliptic boundary value and eigenvalue problems, including a priori error estimation, a posteriori error estimation, adaptive mesh-refinement techniques, convergence rate and optimal complexity; presented at group meetings
* Reviewed the first principles electronic structure calculations, both the mathematical foundation and physical background
* Wrote shell scripts under Linux environmen
* Used C language and Parallel Hierarchical Grid (PHG) package to find finite element solutions and visualize partial differential equations
* Designed algorithms to reduce the computational error and iterations caused by hydrogen atom's small spectral gap in numerical solutions to generalized linear eigenvalue problems
* Proposed the proper arrangement of initial mesh  
  Improved the effective polynomial order for the finite element in the discretization of Kohn-Sham equation
* Designed two integration strategies to calculate the singular integral, Suppressed the error caused by the singularity
* Analyzed the computational error from three aspects: model error, approximation error and numerical error 
  Reduced the model error and numerical error,  Obtained  the variation curves of the approximation error which is the core of finite element approximation with the increase of the polynomial order for the finite element
