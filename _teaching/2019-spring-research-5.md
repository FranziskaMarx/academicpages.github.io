* Studied the basic theory and algorithm of Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks\
* Proposed the moment calculation algorithm of the SMT($\\mathcal\{LRA\}$) random variables for Weighted Model Integration (WMI), Derived the marginal probability density function for WMI\
* Improved the numerical integration step for the algorithm of efficient search-based WMI using Gaussian quadrature rules\
* Devised a novel formulation of MI via an exact message passing scheme on the tractable MI problems  adopting symbolic integration,  which is able to exactly compute all the variable marginal densities -- as well as statistical moments -- at once\
* Proposed an example involving both boolean and continuous variables, both disjunction and conjunction, Elaborated the procedure reducing WMI to MI, passing by WMI$_\{\\mathbb\{R\}\}$\
* Finished the paper-writing on this work and posted the paper to arXiv as joint first author}
