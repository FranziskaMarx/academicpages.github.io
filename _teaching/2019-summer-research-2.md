* Advisor: Prof. Guy Van den Broeck
* Date: Jul 2019 - Sep 2019
* Studied the basic theory and algorithm of Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks
* Proposed the moment calculation algorithm of the SMT($\mathcal{LRA}$) random variables for Weighted Model Integration (WMI), Derived the marginal probability density function for WMI
* Improved the numerical integration step for the algorithm of efficient search-based WMI using Gaussian quadrature rules
* Devised a novel formulation of MI via an exact message passing scheme on the tractable MI problems  adopting symbolic integration,  which is able to exactly compute all the variable marginal densities -- as well as statistical moments -- at once
* Analyzed the treewidth and diameter of the primal graph when the reduction from tree-WMI with bivariate queries to MI played
* Constructed a representative example and Elaborated the procedure of the reduction from WMI to MI, passing by WMI$_{\mathbb{R}}$, including both boolean and continuous variables, both disjunction and conjunction 
* Finished the paper-writing on this work and posted the paper to arXiv as joint first author
