* Proposed several compensation schemes for complex graphical models, including probability matching and moment matching
* Analyzed the convergence property when the relaxed equivalence constraint both connect and disconnect the primal graph
* Analyzed the structure of the primal graph when the reduction from tree-WMI with bivariate queries to WMI$_{\mathbb{R}}$ played
* Analyzed the convexity of the log-likelihood function when the weight functions are in different parametric functions for the parameter learning on WMI
