* Proposed a novel algorithm to approximate Model Integration (MI) inference within the RCR framework, comprise two phases:
  * $\textit{relaxing}$ an intractable MI problem by distilling a simpler one amenable to exact inference out of it
  * perform iterative optimization to $\textit{compensate}$ for the structure lost during relaxation
* Devised various update rules for iterative optimization scheme in the compensation step, including probability matching and moment matching
* Analyzed the convergence property for update equations when the relaxed equivalence constraint both connect and disconnect the primal graph, using the fixed-point theorem
* Studied the Parameter Learning for Markov Logic Networks , 
  Analyzed the convexity of the log-likelihood function for different parametric potentials in WMI parameter learning
